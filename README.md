# Airbnb-Paris-analysis
This project explores the evolution of the Airbnb market in Paris, with a focus on how regulations, locality trends, and pricing dynamics have influenced both host participation and customer demand.
The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insight generation, supported by clear visualizations and actionable business recommendations.

## 📌 Objectives

* Analyze Airbnb supply trends in Paris from 2008 to 2021.
* Evaluate the impact of the **2017 rental regulations** on host participation
* Examine **locality-level pricing patterns** and affordability across neighborhoods.
* Study the relationship between **accommodation capacity** and average price.
* Provide **business insights & recommendations** for stakeholders.

  ## 📊 Key Insights

* **Rapid Growth (2008–2016):** Strong host entry and expansion of listings.
* **Regulatory Shift (2017):** Significant slowdown in new hosts entering the market.
* **Resilient Demand:** Despite fewer new listings, customer demand stayed stable.
* **Pricing Trends:** Competition lowered prices pre-2017, but post-regulation supply constraints pushed prices upward.
* **Locality Insights:** Central Paris commands premium prices, while outer neighborhoods attract budget travelers.


## 🚀 Recommendations

* Focus on **premium central areas** while maintaining offerings in budget-friendly neighborhoods.
* Implement **dynamic pricing** to balance supply-demand fluctuations.
* Diversify listings, especially targeting **medium-capacity stays (3–6 guests)**.
* Strengthen **customer experience** with quality listings and repeat-stay strategies.
* Stay compliant and adapt to evolving **local regulations** for long-term sustainability.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python** (pandas, numpy) – Data cleaning & processing
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis
